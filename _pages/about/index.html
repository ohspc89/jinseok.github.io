My interest later transitioned to the neural control of movement during my Masterâ€™s program. During my Ph.D., I focused on proprioception - the sense of body position and movement in 3D space. Currently, I work on quantifying infant movements using wearable sensors and have developed a growing passion for data management. The connections between my career stages may not seem immediately apparent, but I will continue to live my life to see how the dots ultimately connect.</p> </body></html>
